
Samples are signed 127..-128
Multiplier S8 * U8

???
- how to cast in SV?
- how to multiply S16 * U8 signed using S8 * U8?

Interpolator FSM steps
----------------------

1. Sample old left * (128 - midpoint)     +
2. Sample new left * midpoint                  ->  sample left
3. Sample old right * (128 - midpoint)    +    
4. Sample new right * midpoint                 ->  sample right
5. Sample left * volume left                   -> adder register left
6. Sample right * volume right                 -> adder register right
7. Adder register left * samples volume left   -> FIFO
8. Adder register right * samples volume right -> FIFO

* Steps 3, 4 are for Stereo mode only. In Mono left is copied to the right
* Steps 7, 8 are exexuted at the end of channels iteration
